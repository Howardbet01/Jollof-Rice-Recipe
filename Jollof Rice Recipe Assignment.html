    <h1>Jollof Rice Recipe</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
        <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 large tomatoes, blended into a puree</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, blended into a puree</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, blended into a puree</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste for spice)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Prepare the rice by washing it thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the blended tomato, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper puree. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until the liquid reduces, and the oil begins to separate from the sauce. This might take about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper to the sauce. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the washed rice and stir well to coat the rice evenly with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until it's fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors of the sauce. You can add more broth or water if needed to prevent sticking, but be careful not to make the rice too soggy.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it gently with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Optionally, serve the Jollof rice with grilled or fried chicken, fish, or vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
